<h2>1. Hello, World!</h2>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This shows how to start building a UI with wxml.</p>
<p>Run <code>&lt;python&gt; -m wxml hello.xml</code></p>
<p>After running the above command, you should now see a window like the one below.</p>

<h3>Running in Design Mode</h3>
<p>When you're starting to design a user interface, you probably don't want to have to keep running the above command when you make changes to file.</p>
<p>Fortunately, wxml can be told to watch the given filename for changes and when it detects modifications, it will automatically rebuild the UI for you.</p>
<p>Run <code>&lt;python&gt; -m wxml --design hello.xml</code> or <code>&lt;python&gt; -m wxml -d hello.xml</code></p>
<p>Now, open <code>hello.xml</code> in your text editor of choice and change the StaticText's text attribute to something else (<code>&quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;</code>). After you save the file, the UI will rebuilt automatically and you can see your changes.</p>

<h3>Error Viewer</h3>
<p>If you're running in design mode, you may make an edit that will result in errors when the UI is built. The module comes in a built-in error viewer that can be shown by passing in a debug flag argument.</p>
<p>Run <code>&lt;python&gt; -m wxml -d --debug-flags ERROR hello.xml</code>.</p>
